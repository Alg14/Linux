# OverTheWire Bandit Linux Challenges

This repository documents my progress through the **OverTheWire Bandit wargame**, focusing on **Linux command-line skills, file manipulation, and basic cybersecurity techniques**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Strengthen **Linux fundamentals**  
- Practice **shell navigation, file permissions, process control, and text manipulation**  
- Learn **real-world security concepts** such as SSH, encoding, and file discovery  
- Document each challenge clearly for **reference and revision**

### 🔐 How the Bandit Game Works

The Bandit wargame is built as a **progressive learning challenge**. Each level is essentially a **locked Linux environment**, and your mission is to **locate the password hidden somewhere in the system** using command-line tools and logic.

- Once you **retrieve the password**, you use it to **SSH into the next level.**  
- I **will not disclose** retrieved passwords in this repo — doing so would violate OverTheWire rules and the spirit of the challenges.  
- Every level teaches a **new Linux concept** — from file permission tricks to encoded files, hidden directories, noisy logs, or redirected output.  
- This structure encourages **real problem-solving instead of memorization**, making it excellent preparation for **DevOps and security work**, where discovering and understanding system behavior is essential.
